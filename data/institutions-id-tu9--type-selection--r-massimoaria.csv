https://openalex.org/W4286472674,From Shelters to Dwellings,,"In Zaatari camp, Jordan, thousands of Syrian refugees were sheltered in tents and caravans, which they steadily appropriated and turned into dwellings that responded to their social and cultural needs. In this book, Ayham Dalal takes a closer look at this remarkable transformation. He draws on the tension between 'the shelter' and 'the dwelling' to unravel how new spaces unfold in between them, where refugees become architects and the camp is dismantled and reassembled. From Shelters to Dwellings is the first study to uniquely combine ethnographic observations with new architectural research methods, to illustrate in detail how refugees inhabit shelters. It is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding how camps and shelters are transformed by the powerful act of dwelling.",2022-07-04,Re-Figuration von Räumen,,,,https://doi.org/10.14361/9783839458389,,,,,FALSE,0,,2022,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4286472674,,https://doi.org/10.14361/9783839458389,monograph,,,
https://openalex.org/W4286472790,Von unmittelbarer Demokratie zur Repräsentation,,"Zahlreiche bürgerliche Revolutionäre haben im 18. Jahrhundert die Demokratie begrifflich aufgewertet. Mit diesem Wandel ging aber ein zweiter einher: Die Demokratie wird zur repräsentativen Form umgedeutet, was dem demokratischen Prinzip jedoch entgegen steht. Repräsentationssysteme sind mit einer aristokratischen Rekrutierung des Amtspersonals per Wahl und der Abgabe politischer Macht an Repräsentanten nur eine elitäre »Alternative«. Philip Dingeldey analysiert diese fundamentale Umdeutung der Demokratie, die mit einem aristokratischen Republikkonzept verbunden ist und keine Weiterentwicklung der klassischen Demokratie mit der direkten, freien und gleichen Selbstgesetzgebung der Bürgerschaft darstellt.",2022-07-04,Edition Politik,https://openalex.org/V4210193950,,,https://doi.org/10.14361/9783839463260,,,,,FALSE,0,,2022,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4286472790,,https://doi.org/10.14361/9783839463260,monograph,,,

David Joshua Schröder geht dieser Frage nach, indem er sich der neuen räumlichen Gestalt dieser Orte soziologisch zuwendet. Ihren Wandel nimmt er nicht nur zum Anlass, um neue Arbeitsweisen herauszuarbeiten, sondern er tastet sich auch an die Frage heran, was sich aus diesen Veränderungen für die heutige Raumkontrolle in der refigurierten Moderne schließen lässt. Dabei zeigt er auf, dass Raum und Digitalisierung hier auf eine Weise verbunden sind, die keinesfalls zu einer allmählichen Auflösung dieser Orte führt.",2022-07-04,Re-Figuration von Räumen,,,,https://doi.org/10.14361/9783839462331,,,,,FALSE,0,,2022,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4286472889,,https://doi.org/10.14361/9783839462331,monograph,,,

https://openalex.org/W4206508063,Modularity and Dynamics on Complex Networks,,"Complex networks are typically not homogeneous, as they tend to display an array of structures at different scales. A feature that has attracted a lot of research is their modular organisation, i.e., networks may often be considered as being composed of certain building blocks, or modules. In this Element, the authors discuss a number of ways in which this idea of modularity can be conceptualised, focusing specifically on the interplay between modular network structure and dynamics taking place on a network. They discuss, in particular, how modular structure and symmetries may impact on network dynamics and, vice versa, how observations of such dynamics may be used to infer the modular structure. They also revisit several other notions of modularity that have been proposed for complex networks and show how these can be related to and interpreted from the point of view of dynamical processes on networks.",2021-12-21,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108774116,,,,,FALSE,0,,2021,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W4206508063,,https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108774116,monograph,,,

https://openalex.org/W4200308375,FlexOS: Towards Flexible OS Isolation,,"At design time, modern operating systems are locked in a specific safety and isolation strategy that mixes one or more hardware/software protection mechanisms (e.g. user/kernel separation); revisiting these choices after deployment requires a major refactoring effort. This rigid approach shows its limits given the wide variety of modern applications' safety/performance requirements, when new hardware isolation mechanisms are rolled out, or when existing ones break. We present FlexOS, a novel OS allowing users to easily specialize the safety and isolation strategy of an OS at compilation/deployment time instead of design time. This modular LibOS is composed of fine-grained components that can be isolated via a range of hardware protection mechanisms with various data sharing strategies and additional software hardening. The OS ships with an exploration technique helping the user navigate the vast safety/performance design space it unlocks. We implement a prototype of the system and demonstrate, for several applications (Redis/Nginx/SQLite), FlexOS' vast configuration space as well as the efficiency of the exploration technique: we evaluate 80 FlexOS configurations for Redis and show how that space can be probabilistically subset to the 5 safest ones under a given performance budget.

CVE and de-radicalisation programmes have seen a significant rise in recent years and are now cornerstones of many countries’ counterterrorism strategies. Despite the increased importance of these tools to counter violent radicalisation leading to terrorism, they remain controversial and sometimes receive fierce public criticism and opposition. This work looks at how CVE and de-radicalisation programs are able to influence a country’s discourse on de-radicalisation, and how far governmental programs differ from non-governmental initiatives in terms of their PR strategies. The book also provides a theoretical basis of how the discourse on CVE is constructed in the media. As major case studies, this book examines the United Kingdom, Germany and Nigeria. For these countries, the authors have gathered and assessed roughly 3,000 newspaper articles on de-radicalisation programmes over a decade to provide an empirical base.

https://openalex.org/W3172069385,Active Learning of Continuous-time Bayesian Networks through Interventions,,"We consider the problem of learning structures and parameters of Continuous-time Bayesian Networks (CTBNs) from time-course data under minimal experimental resources. In practice, the cost of generating experimental data poses a bottleneck, especially in the natural and social sciences. A popular approach to overcome this is Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED). However, BOED becomes infeasible in high-dimensional settings, as it involves integration over all possible experimental outcomes. We propose a novel criterion for experimental design based on a variational approximation of the expected information gain. We show that for CTBNs, a semi-analytical expression for this criterion can be calculated for structure and parameter learning. By doing so, we can replace sampling over experimental outcomes by solving the CTBNs master-equation, for which scalable approximations exist. This alleviates the computational burden of sampling possible experimental outcomes in high-dimensions. We employ this framework in order to recommend interventional sequences. In this context, we extend the CTBN model to conditional CTBNs in order to incorporate interventions. We demonstrate the performance of our criterion on synthetic and real-world data.",2021-05-31,arXiv: Machine Learning,https://openalex.org/V2597365278,,,https://zenodo.org/record/5234917,,,,,TRUE,0,,2021,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3172069385,,https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5234917,proceedings,,,

A companion to the successful undergraduate textbook Measures, Integrals and Martingales, it is accessible to advanced undergraduate students, requiring only modest prerequisites.

https://openalex.org/W2912554321,Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security,,"Since its inauguration in 2006 in Taipei, ASIACCS, the ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security, has become an integral part of scientific community in the field of security and privacy. It has been held in Singapore (2007), Tokyo (2008), Sydney (2009), Beijing (2010), Hong Kong (2011), Seoul (2012), Hangzhou (2013), Kyoto (2014), Singapore (2015), and Xi'an (2016).

ASIACCS 2017 takes place in Abu Dhabi and is organized by the New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE. We received 359 submissions, a new record in the conference's decade-long history. This year's Program Committee comprising 108 security researchers from 26 countries, evaluated submissions through a rigorous review procedure. For the first time in the conference's history, a Shadow Program Committee (SPC), composed of 27 security researchers from 14 countries, was introduced. The task of the SPC members was to comment on the reviews made by the PC members, in addition to reviewing the corresponding papers. On the one hand, the SPC comments greatly helped to significantly enhance the quality the many reviews. On the other hand, to provide the anonymity for SPC members, they could not directly debate with the PC members, which was largely due to technological limitations: HotCRP (or any review software for that matter) is not designed to have some accounts only seeing some information. We had a discussion of doubleblind vs. single-blind requirements. One of our main goals when designing the system was to ensure that junior reviewers in the SPC could raise criticism of senior reviewers with impunity. Despite the management effort, we believe that implementing the SPC concept was successful. We also learned useful lessons on how to improve it.

After the review process concluded, 67 full papers were accepted to be presented at the conference, representing an acceptance rate of about 18%. In addition, 4 short papers and 10 posters/demos were also included in the program.

We have a strong technical program along with 5 specialized pre-conference workshops, three tutorials and an invited talk track that is introduced this year.

The pre-conference workshops are 4th ACM ASIA Public-Key Cryptography Workshop (APKC 2017), ACM Workshop on Blockchain, Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (BCC'17), 3rd ACM Cyber-Physical System Security Workshop (CPSS 2017), 3rd International Workshop on IoT Privacy, Trust, and Security (IoTPTS 2017), 4th International Workshop on Security in Cloud Computing (SCC).

We are fortunate to have distinguished keynote and invited speakers as well as tutorial lecturers who will present insights into current and future security and privacy research trends. There are three keynotes: Ross Anderson (University of Cambridge, UK), Christof Paar (Ruhr-University Bochum, Germany), and Gregory Neal Akers (Senior Vice President, Cisco Systems). Additionally, there are six invited talks by Mustaque Ahamad (Georgia Institute of Technology, US), Srdjan Capkun (ETH, Switzerland), Ivan Martinovic (Oxford University, UK), David Naccache (ENS, France), Matthias Payer (Purdue, US) and Gene Tsudik (UC Irvine, US).

https://openalex.org/W2757382943,POWERSKIN CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS,,"The building skin has evolved enormously over the past decades. The energy performance and environmental quality of both the interior and exterior of buildings are primarily determined by the building envelope. The façade has experienced a change in its role as an adaptive climate control system that leverages the synergies between form, material, mechanical and energy systems towards an architectural integration of energy generation. The PowerSKIN Conference aims to address the role of building skins to accomplish a carbonneutral building stock. The focus of the PowerSKIN issue 2021 deals with the question of whether simplicity and robustness stay in contradiction to good performance of buildings skins or whether they even complement each other: simplicity vs performance? As an international scientific event - usually held at the BAU trade fair in Munich - the PowerSKIN Conference builds a bridge between science and practice, between research and construction, and between the latest developments and innovations for the façade of the future. Topics such as building operation, embodied energy, energy generation and storage in the context of the three conference sessions envelope, energy and environment are considered: – Envelope: The building envelope as an interface for the interaction between indoor and outdoor environment. This topic is focused on function, technical development and material properties. – Energy: New concepts, accomplished projects, and visions for the interaction between building structure, envelope and energy technologies. – Environment: Façades or elements of façades, which aim to provide highly comfortable surroundings where environmental control strategies as well as energy generation and/or storage are an integrated part of an active skin. The Technical University of Munich, TU Darmstadt, and TU Delft are signing responsible for the organisation of the conference. It is the third event of a biennial series: April 9th 2021, architects, engineers, and scientists present their latest developments and research projects for public discussion and reflection. For the first time, the conference will be a virtual event. On the one hand, this is a pity, as conferences are also about meeting people and social interaction; on the other hand, it offers the possibility that we can reach more people who connect from all over the world.",2021-04-07,,,TU Delft Open,,https://doi.org/10.47982/bookrxiv.27,,,,,TRUE,0,,2021,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2757382943,,https://doi.org/10.47982/bookrxiv.27,book,,,

https://openalex.org/W3161670715,Three-dimensional printing in healthcare,,"This work aims to briefly present the cutting edge of 3D printing innovation in healthcare. This technology is used for surgical planning, medical education, bioprinting of tissues, and medical equipment spare parts in fields like pharmacology, prosthetics, surgery, and regenerative medicine. A review of the last decade was made in the search engines of PubMed and Espacenet. Three authors reviewed titles, abstracts, and keywords separately to identify studies appropriate to the topic. After the initial examination, complete texts of identified relevant studies were obtained and classified according to the authors. Results were synthesized in a narrative literature review. The revision showed that 3D printing has become of common use in the healthcare system since it allows medical personnel to implement customized solutions for each patient, thus reducing the probability of a false diagnostic or treatment. Major applications among the advantages and disadvantages of 3D printing in healthcare were presented. Nowadays, the main challenge in 3D printing is the cost of the equipment and its manufacturing. In the future, the challenges in cost could be reduced, but processing requirements and limited materials may still need further work.",2021-03-21,,,Sociedad Mexicana de Ingeniería Biomédica,,https://doi.org/10.17488/rmib.42.2.3,,,,,TRUE,0,,2021,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3161670715,,https://doi.org/10.17488/rmib.42.2.3,dissertation,,,

Correspondingly, the vehicle basic shape especially the rear end shape becomes more numerous. In addition to the three typical rear end shapes – notchback, fastback and squareback – some new concepts are derived from a mixture of those classic rear end shapes. For example, as demonstrated in Figure 1, an SUV-coupe like vehicle has a much higher trunk and a more raised trunk lid slope angle than a normal limousine or coupe. On some limousine models like the Porsche Panamera Sport, the rear end shape is designed as a fastback. Its rear screen angle is smaller than a station wagon.

https://openalex.org/W3119833516,"Theory and Practice of Modern Antenna Range Measurements, 2nd Expanded Edition, Volume 2",,"This greatly expanded, co-authored, two-volume text provides a comprehensive introduction and explanation of both the theory and practice of modern antenna measurements, from their most basic postulates and assumptions, to the intricate details of their applications in various demanding modern measurement scenarios. Starting with an initial examination of the properties of antennas that allow them to enhance the free-space interaction of electronic systems, the authors then introduce direct far-field and indirect far-field forms of antenna measurements and their various implementations. Detailed descriptions are given of the direct far-field measurement technique CATR (Compact Antenna Test Ranges), Body-Centric measurements, and detailed developments of standard planar, cylindrical, spherical and non-canonical near-field techniques; and includes a through treatment of near-field range error budgets which are an indispensable part of antenna metrology. The books conclude with recent advances in measurement techniques such as aperture diagnostics, phase-less antenna metrology, error correction, and range multi-path suppression techniques.

Starting with an initial examination of the properties of antennas that allow them to enhance the free-space interaction of electronic systems, the authors then introduce direct far-field and indirect far-field forms of antenna measurements and their various implementations. Detailed descriptions are given of the direct far-field measurement technique CATR (Compact Antenna Test Ranges), Body-Centric measurements, and detailed developments of standard planar, cylindrical, spherical and non-canonical near-field techniques; and includes a through treatment of near-field range error budgets which are an indispensable part of antenna metrology. The books conclude with recent advances in measurement techniques such as aperture diagnostics, phase-less antenna metrology, error correction, and range multi-path suppression techniques.

https://openalex.org/W2276056662,The Multi-Agent Transport Simulation MATSim,,"The MATSim (Multi-Agent Transport Simulation) software project was started around 2006 with the goal of generating traffic and congestion patterns by following individual synthetic travelers through their daily or weekly activity programme. It has since then evolved from a collection of stand-alone C++ programs to an integrated Java-based framework which is publicly hosted, open-source available, automatically regression tested. It is currently used by about 40 groups throughout the world. This book takes stock of the current status. The first part of the book gives an introduction to the most important concepts, with the intention of enabling a potential user to set up and run basic simulations. The second part of the book describes how the basic functionality can be extended, for example by adding schedule-based public transit, electric or autonomous cars, paratransit, or within-day replanning. For each extension, the text provides pointers to the additional documentation and to the code base. It is also discussed how people with appropriate Java programming skills can write their own extensions, and plug them into the MATSim core. The project has started from the basic idea that traffic is a consequence of human behavior, and thus humans and their behavior should be the starting point of all modelling, and with the intuition that when simulations with 100 million particles are possible in computational physics, then behavior-oriented simulations with 10 million travelers should be possible in travel behavior research. The initial implementations thus combined concepts from computational physics and complex adaptive systems with concepts from travel behavior research. The third part of the book looks at theoretical concepts that are able to describe important aspects of the simulation system; for example, under certain conditions the code becomes a Monte Carlo engine sampling from a discrete choice model. Another important aspect is the interpretation of the MATSim score as utility in the microeconomic sense, opening up a connection to benefit cost analysis. Finally, the book collects use cases as they have been undertaken with MATSim. All current users of MATSim were invited to submit their work, and many followed with sometimes crisp and short and sometimes longer contributions, always with pointers to additional references. We hope that the book will become an invitation to explore, to build and to extend agent-based modeling of travel behavior from the stable and well tested core of MATSim documented here.",2020-10-09,,,,,http://doi.org/10.5334%2fbaw,,,,,FALSE,147,,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2276056662,,,book,,,

https://openalex.org/W2914194111,Proceedings of the 2020 International Symposium on Wearable Computers,,"Welcome to Zurich! The program of the International Symposium on Wearable Computers 2013 features a mix of long papers, short papers, and posters. This year we received 101 submissions: 54 long papers (up to eight pages), 34 short papers (four pages), and 13 posters (two pages). This is the largest number of ISWC submissions in the last eight years, and continues the upward trend of both wearable computing and the participation in the Symposium. Submissions came from all over the world, with a good balance between North America, Europe, and Asia.

For the review process, we appointed 27 Program Committee members combining long-standing members of the ISWC community as well as new colleagues. All papers were reviewed by at least two PC members and at least one expert external to the PC. All paper formats were held to the same high standards, requiring novelty and a valuable contribution to the field. The decisions on paper acceptance were reached at a two-site PC meeting (in Zurich and San Jose) on May 13th, 2013. We thank all PC members for their participation and for their willingness to engage in technical discussions around dawn in California and midnight in Switzerland! We also thank all the reviewers who dedicated their time to provide high quality reviews. For the submitted long papers, 6 were accepted as long, 5 were also accepted as long with shepherded revision, 2 were shepherded to short papers, and 2 were shepherded to posters. For short papers, 5 were accepted as short, 2 were also accepted as short with shepherded revision, and 6 were shepherded to posters. Finally, regarding the submitted posters, 1 was accepted as such, and 2 were also accepted with shepherded revision. Shepherds ensured that the changes suggested by the reviewers were taken into account in the final versions. The process resulted in 20% acceptance rate for long papers, 23% for oral presentations (long and short papers), and 31% overall acceptance. We thank the authors for their effort to revise and improve the final version of their contributions. The proceedings will be included in the ACM Digital Library and indexed by IEEE.

To acknowledge the quality of this year's papers, we shortlisted five long papers as candidates for Best Student Paper Award and Best Paper Award. An Award committee was appointed to reach a final decision. The Awards will be announced at the end of the conference. Finally, as a novelty to the program, ISWC will also give its first Best Reviewer Award to thank the effort and commitment of nour reviewer community.

https://openalex.org/W3043905768,Silicon-Based Photonics,,"Silicon photonics has evolved rapidly as a research topic with enormous application potential. The high refractive index contrast of silicon-on-insulator (SOI) shows great promise for submicron waveguide structures suited for integration on the chip scale in the near-infrared region. Ge- and GeSn-Si heterostructures with different elastic strain levels already provide expansion of the spectral range, high-speed operation, efficient modulation and switching of optical signals, and enhanced light emission and lasing. 
This book focuses on the integration of heterostructure devices with silicon photonics. The authors have attempted to merge a concise treatment of classical silicon photonics with a description of principles, prospects, challenges, and technical solution paths of adding silicon-based heterostructures. The book discusses the basics of heterostructure-based silicon photonics, system layouts, and key device components, keeping in mind the application background. Special focus is placed on SOI-based waveguide configurations and Ge- and GeSn-Si heterostructure devices for light detection, modulation, and light emission and lasing. The book also provides an overview of the technological and materials science challenges connected with integration on silicon. The first half of the book is mainly for readers who are interested in the topic because of its increasing importance in different fields, while the latter half covers different device structures for light emission, detection, modulation, extension of the wavelength beyond 1.6 μm, and lasing, as well as future challenges.",2020-07-24,,,Jenny Stanford Publishing,,https://doi.org/10.1201/9781315156514,,,,,TRUE,1,,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3043905768,,https://doi.org/10.1201/9781315156514,reference-book,,,

https://openalex.org/W2941591117,Optimization of Trustworthy Biomolecular Quantitative Analysis Using Cyber-Physical Microfluidic Platforms,,"Considerable effort has been devoted in recent years to the design and implementation of microfluidic platforms for biomolecular quantitative analysis. However, today's platforms suffer from two major limitations: (1) they were optimized for sample-limited analyses, thus they are inadequate for practical quantitative analysis and the processing of multiple samples through independent pathways; (2) the integrity of these platforms and their biochemical operations is still an open question, since no protection schemes were developed against adversarial contamination or result-manipulation risks. Design optimization techniques for microfluidics have been studied in recent years, but they overlook the myriad complexities of biomolecular protocols and are yet to make an impact in microbiology research. The realization of microfluidic platforms for real-life quantitative analysis requires: (1) a new optimization flow that is based on the realistic modeling of biomolecular protocols, and (2) a microfluidic security flow that provides a high-level of confidence in the integrity of miniaturized quantitative analysis. Motivated by the above needs, this dissertation is focused on optimized and trustworthy transfer of benchtop biomolecular analysis, particularly epigenetic studies, to programmable and cyber-physical microfluidic biochips. The dissertation first presents a set of optimization mechanisms that leverages cyber-physical integration to enable real-time execution of multi-sample biomolecular analysis. The proposed methods include a resource-allocation scheme that responds to decisions about the protocol flow, an interactive firmware that collects and analyzes sensor data, and a spatio-temporal reconfiguration technique that aims to enhance the reliability of the microfluidic system. An envisioned design for an Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based microfluidics-driven service is also presented to cope with the complexity of coordinated biomolecular research. Next, this dissertation advances single-cell protocols by presenting optimized microfluidic methods for high-throughput cell differentiation. The proposed methods target pin-constrained design of reconfigurable microfluidic systems and real-time synthesis of a pool of heterogeneous cells through the complete flow of single-cell analysis. A performance model related to single-cell screening is also presented based on computational fluid-dynamics simulations. With the increasing complexity of microbiology research, optimized protocol preparation and fault-tolerant execution have become critical requirements in today's biomolecular frameworks. This dissertation presents a design method for reagent preparation for parameter-space exploration. Trade-offs between reagent usage and protocol efficiency are investigated. Moreover, an integrated design for automated error recovery in cyber-physical biochips is demonstrated using a fabricated chip.

https://openalex.org/W3037308746,Computational Science – ICCS 2020,,"Many problems in science and engineering require uncertainty quantification that accounts for observed data. For example, in computational neuroscience, Neural Population Models (NPMs) are mechanistic models that describe brain physiology in a range of different states. Within computational neuroscience there is growing interest in the inverse problem of inferring NPM parameters from recordings such as the EEG (Electroencephalogram). Uncertainty quantification is essential in this application area in order to infer the mechanistic effect of interventions such as anaesthesia. This paper presents C++ software for Bayesian uncertainty quantification in the parameters of NPMs from approximately stationary data using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Modern MCMC methods require first order (and in some cases higher order) derivatives of the posterior density. The software presented offers two distinct methods of evaluating derivatives: finite differences and exact derivatives obtained through Algorithmic Differentiation (AD). For AD, two different implementations are used: the open source Stan Math Library and the commercially licenced dco/c++ tool distributed by NAG (Numerical Algorithms Group). The use of derivative information in MCMC sampling is demonstrated through a simple example, the noise-driven harmonic oscillator. And different methods for computing derivatives are compared. The software is written in a modular object-oriented way such that it can be extended to derivative based MCMC for other scientific domains.",2020-05-28,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,https://openalex.org/V106296714,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-50436-6,,,,,TRUE,0,,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3037308746,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-50436-6,book,,,
https://openalex.org/W3024577869,Neutron-scattering studies of spin dynamics in pure and doped CeB6,,"As a simple cubic system with only one f electron per cerium ion, CeB6 is of model character to investigate the interplay of orbital phenomena with magnetism. It is also a textbook example of a compound that exhibits magnetically hidden order -- a low-temperature magnetic phase with ordered quadrupolar moments. It is difficult to identify the symmetry of such hidden-order states in common x-ray or neutron scattering experiments, as there is no signal in zero field, however alternative techniques like neutron diffraction in external field, resonant x-ray scattering, or ultrasonic investigations can be applied. Another possible method for characterizing hidden order is to look at the magnetic excitation spectrum, which carries the imprint of the multipolar interactions and the hidden order parameter in its dispersion relations. Using a specific candidate model, the dispersion is calculated and then compared to that measured with inelastic neutron scattering. Until recently, only a limited amount of data which show the presence of dispersing excitations measured along a few high-symmetry directions in an applied magnetic field were available. Early attempts to compare such calculations with experiments showed that only strongest modes at high-symmetry points could be identified. The present review of the most recent neutron-scattering results is intended to satisfy the need of more accurate inelastic neutron-scattering experiments as a function of field and temperature, giving us the opportunity to identify existing excitation branches in CeB6 and conclusively compare them with the theoretically predicted multipolar excitations.",2020-05-15,arXiv: Strongly Correlated Electrons,https://openalex.org/V2595780900,,,https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003146483,,,,,TRUE,2,,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3024577869,,,book,,,

It incorporates tools and methods from algebraic geometry, topology, combinatorics and computer algebra, and has since evolved substantially. With this book, the authors meet the need for a contemporary treatment, complementing in core areas the well-established books of Carter and Digne–Michel. Focusing on applications in finite group theory, the authors gather previously scattered results and allow the reader to get to grips with the large body of literature available on the subject, covering topics such as regular embeddings, the Jordan decomposition of characters, d-Harish–Chandra theory and Lusztig induction for unipotent characters.

We are particularly interested in understanding the region of coexistence, i.e. the interface between the two types. In this chapter, we give an overview over our results that describe the dynamics of these interfaces at large scales. One of the reasons that this system is tractable is that it exhibits a rich duality theory.

https://openalex.org/W2125485246,"Do Weak Institutions Prolong Crises? On the Identification, Characteristics, and Duration of Declines during Economic Slumps",,"This paper studies periods of prolonged contractions in output per capita in a sample of 145 countries from 1950 to 2014. Economic slumps are defined as abrupt interruptions of a period of growth by several regime switches. Slumps start with a sharp contraction along with a trend break, which is followed by another switch when growth stabilizes again. The paper then analyzes the correlates of these slumps, focusing on the length and depth of the contraction, from the beginning of the slump to its trough. The results establish three new stylized facts: (i) weak political institutions predate crises whereas political reforms tend to follow them, (ii) the length and depth of economic declines are robustly correlated with executive constraints and ethnic heterogeneity, and (iii) there is a robust interaction between these two variables, suggesting that institutions constraining leaders are important for stabilizing growth. This is particularly relevant for Sub-Saharan Africa, where politics are often ethnic and decision makers are comparatively unconstrained.",2020-01-29,The World Bank Economic Review,https://openalex.org/V2735890421,Oxford University Press,,https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-9127,,,,,TRUE,2,,2020,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2125485246,,https://doi.org/10.1596/1813-9450-9127,book,,,

In the nineties, modern algebraic theories were introduced in mathematical systems theory and in control theory. Combined with real algebraic geometry, which was previously introduced in control theory, the past years have seen a flourishing development of algebraic methods in control theory. One of the strengths of algebraic methods lies in their close connections to computations. The use of the above-mentioned algebraic theories in control theory has been an important source of motivation to develop effective versions of these theories (when possible). With the development of computer algebra and computer algebra systems, symbolic methods for control theory have been developed over the past years. The goal of this book is to propose a partial state of the art in this direction.

Designed for researchers and graduate students in machine learning, this book summarizes recent developments in the non-asymptotic and asymptotic theory of variational Bayesian learning and suggests how this theory can be applied in practice. The authors begin by developing a basic framework with a focus on conjugacy, which enables the reader to derive tractable algorithms. Next, it summarizes non-asymptotic theory, which, although limited in application to bilinear models, precisely describes the behavior of the variational Bayesian solution and reveals its sparsity inducing mechanism. Finally, the text summarizes asymptotic theory, which reveals phase transition phenomena depending on the prior setting, thus providing suggestions on how to set hyperparameters for particular purposes. Detailed derivations allow readers to follow along without prior knowledge of the mathematical techniques specific to Bayesian learning.",2019-08-22,,,,,https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/variational-bayesian-learning-theory/0F6AABA050630E01E1B6EDA5E2CAFA05,,,,,,2,,2019,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2954745523,,,book,,,

https://openalex.org/W3044152512,Computationally-aided design of aluminum alloys for high electrical conductivity power grids,,"Due to their high electrical conductivity and relatively high melting temperature compared to other highly conductive metals (1.72×10-8 Ω.m), copper alloys have been used widely in power grids. However, in the recent decades, the price of copper alloys has increased substantially. For this reason, the demand for new alloys which can be used instead of copper has increased. The working temperature of the power grids is 140 °C, with short periods of up to 200 °C. Therefore, new developed materials should possess equal or better mechanical properties (creep resistance) at these temperatures, as well as high electrical conductivity, and also a reasonable price compared to copper alloys. For these reasons, aluminum alloys
are among the most promising candidates.
In this study, new aluminum alloys have been developed and investigated. Aluminum alloys have a high electrical conductivity, which satisfies this requirement for the power grids. However due to their low melting temperature, creep mechanisms are active in the temperature range of the working condition of power grids. In order to use aluminum alloys in power grids, it is necessary to develop alloys with high strength and creep resistance. Based on the mentioned demands, new aluminum alloys were produced and investigated in this work. The strain hardening mechanism is known to deteriorate the electrical conductivity. Therefore, AA3105 aluminum alloy as a precipitation hardened alloy and Al-Zr-Fe aluminum
alloy as a solid solution hardened alloy were produced and investigated.
In order to optimize the mechanical properties of AA3105 aluminum alloys, the precipitation sequence of the alloys were investigated by means of DSC measurements, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) investigations, simulations and creep tests. The precipitation behavior of as-cast AA6016, AA6005 and A3105 aluminum alloys was simulated by means of a classical nucleation and growth model. The model was coupled with a thermodynamic database containing the elements Al, Mg, Si, Fe, Cu and Mn with their corresponding stable and metastable phases. The focus of the investigation was laid on the evolution of β″, β′, β (Mg2Si) and Si phases. DSC tests were conducted in the temperature range of 100-500 °C. The simulation results were compared to results of the DSC experiments. The simulation results showed a very good agreement with the experimentally measured DSC curves and the average particle size. TEM investigations were conducted on the DSC samples in order to identify the precipitated phases at certain temperatures and the precipitation sequence was determined for AA3105 aluminum alloy. The evolution of the α-Al(Mn,Fe)Si phase was studied with and without the presence of Mg-Si phases. The α-Al(Mn,Fe)Si particles can improve the mechanical properties at elevated temperatures, unlike the Mg-Si phases. It was found that Mg addition accelerates the
precipitation of the α-Al(Mn,Fe)Si particles, and it shifts the precipitation to lower temperatures during DSC measurement. This effect appears to be caused by local enrichment of the matrix, rather than direct phase transformation, since heterogeneous nucleation of αAl(Mn,Fe)Si particles on the u-phase was not observed during the investigations. With high probability, the precipitation sequence of the AA3105 aluminum alloy with Mg was: (GP zones) → β′′ → β′ → α-Al(Mn,Fe)Si → β(Mg2Si). Without Mg, the sequence was described as: small spherical precipitates with an unknown structure → α-Al(Mn,Fe)Si. Based on the simulations, new heat treatments were proposed and investigated. From their results, a new production
process was proposed.
The creep behavior of the as-cast Al-Zr-Fe and AA3105 aluminum alloys was also investigated. The creep mechanism of AA3105 and Al-Zr-Fe aluminum alloys at low stresses and temperatures is dislocation annihilation by cross slip at cell walls. At low stresses and intermediate temperatures, the pipe-diffusion-controlled dislocation climb dominates. For AA3105 aluminum alloys, dislocation glide with a drag stress is dominant at high temperatures and high stresses. However, for Al-Zr-Fe, a power-law break down occurs at high temperatures and high stresses. Comparing the creep behavior of the AA3105 and Al-Zr-Fe aluminum alloys shows that the Al-Zr-Fe aluminum alloy has a better creep resistance at low stresses up to 65 MPa, due to the solid solution hardening, but at high stresses the AA3105 aluminum alloy shows a better creep resistance, which is due to the smaller grain diameter and precipitation hardening.
Based on the conducted study and understanding of the precipitation kinetics of AA3105 aluminum alloy, and also the creep behavior of both alloys, a new production chain is proposed for AA3105 aluminum alloy which is expected to lead to a higher creep resistance compared to the conventionally produced AA3105 aluminum alloy, and which is expected to fulfil the requirements of power grids.",2019-05-14,,,Rheinisch-Westfälischen Technischen Hochschule Aachen,,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02904515/document,,,,,FALSE,0,,2019,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3044152512,,,dissertation,,,

https://openalex.org/W2915036706,Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science,,"This book contains the proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science (CLOSER 2014) which was organized and sponsored by the Institute for Systems and Technologies of Information, Control and Communication (INSTICC). This conference was held in Cooperation with the Association for Computing Machinery - Special Interest Group on Management Information Systems.

The technical program of CLOSER 2014 covered areas like âCloud Computing Fundamentalsâ, âServices Science Foundation for Cloud Computingâ, âCloud Computing Platforms and Applicationsâ, âCloud Computing Enabling Technologyâ and âMobile Cloud Computing and Services.â We expect that these proceedings will appeal to a broad audience of engineers, scientists and business people interested in cloud computing and service systems. We further believe that the papers in these proceedings demonstrate new and innovative solutions, and highlight technical problems in the mentioned areas that are challenging and worthwhile. 

The conference was also complemented with one workshop and two special sessions namely the Emerging Software as a Service and Analytics - ESaaSA 2014 (co-chaired by Victor Chang, Gary Wills and Robert Walters ); Special Session on Federated Cloud Governance - FedCloudGov 2014 (chaired by Victor Mendez Munoz) and the Special Session on Multi-Clouds - MultiCloud 2014 (chaired by Dana Petcu).

CLOSER 2014 received 127 paper submissions from all continents. From these, 21 papers were published and presented as full papers, 40 were accepted as short papers and another 27 were presented as posters. These numbers, leading to a full-paper acceptance ratio of 16,54% and an oral paper acceptance ratio of 48%, show the intention of preserving a high quality forum for the next editions of this conference. 

The high quality of the CLOSER 2014 programme was enhanced by three keynote lectures, delivered by experts in their fields, including (alphabetically): Helge Meinhard (CERN, IT Department, Switzerland), Ignacio Martin Llorente (OpenNebula Director and CEO & Full Professor at UCM, Spain) and Paulo Goncalves (INRIA-DANTE, France).

The high number and high quality of the papers received imposed difficult choices in the review process. Each paper was reviewed by at least two experts. Those papers that, according to the reviews, were considered adequately balanced in terms of quality, originality and relevance to the conference themes were selected. We hope that these Conference Proceedings, submitted for indexation to Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index, INSPEC, DBLP, EI and Scopus, may help the Cloud Computing community to find interesting research work. All presented papers will soon be available at the SCITEPRESS digital library. Furthermore, a short list of presented papers will be selected and their authors will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to be included in a forthcoming book of CLOSER Selected Papers to be published by Springer during 2014. 

At the closing session, awards based on the best combined marks of paper reviewing, as assessed by the Program Committee, and the quality of the presentation, as assessed by session chairs at the conference venue, were conferred to the best papers and the best student papers submitted to the conference. 

In conjunction with a set of related conferences, namely WEBIST and SMARTGREENS, CLOSER had a new kind of session, named The European Project Space (EPS). The EPS aimed to provide insights into the research projects that are currently going on in Europe within the fields of web-based information systems, Cloud Computing and Smart Grids and Green IT Systems. This initiative intended to facilitate opportunities for knowledge and technology sharing, and establish the basis for future collaboration networks involving current project partners and interested conference delegates. 

Finally, we would like to express our thanks, first of all, to the authors of the technical papers, whose work and dedication make possible to put together a program that we believe is very exciting and of high technical quality. Next, we would like to thank all the members of the program committee and auxiliary reviewers, who helped us with their expertise and time. We would also like to thank the invited speakers for their invaluable contribution and for sharing their vision with the CLOSER 2014 audience.

Investigating the organizational and representative practices of Koalition der Freien Szene (Coalition of the Independent Scene) – a trans-disciplinary action platform assembling a wide variety of cultural producers in Berlin – the author unpacks the political organization of one of the most compelling contemporary art scenes, or ‘creative’ cities, worldwide, analysing both its concrete policy ‘success’ and the means by which it seeks to challenge and rearticulate the meaning of Berlin as a ‘creative’ city from the producers’ point of view. The book thus opens new opportunities for long-term transformations of the cultural political field. Theoretically sophisticated and based on empirical material including interviews with spokespeople and cultural administrators, Agonistic Articulations in the ‘Creative’ City presents a unique conceptualization of new modes of political collectivization, representation and legitimacy that imagine new avenues of political engagement at a time when political institutions, parties and regimes of representation are in crisis.

This development is closely linked to more sustainable products and production and will subsequently affect the production systems. It is envisaged that factories and distributed production sites will be able to move back to the city through cleaner and more sustainable production processes. There is, however, a dearth of research into investigating suitability of existing products that can be produced in an urban environment. Therefore, this paper explores a possible approach to identify the suitability of products to be produced in urban environments based on the generic attributes of products which shape their corresponding manufacturing systems and their economic, environmental, and social impact on the urban environment. It allows matching of products to cities in order to create combinations of products and factories with suitable urban areas that positively benefit both industry and cities and supports the design of products for urban factories.",2019-01-01,,,Springer,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-1181-9,,,,,FALSE,1,,2019,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2908286150,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-1181-9,book,,,

Zugleich machen sich viele Menschen Sorgen, dass die Prozesse der Rationalisierung und Modernisierung der landwirtschaftlichen Produktion auf Kosten von Natur-, Umwelt- und Tierschutz gehen. Auf vielen Ebenen wird daher bereits nach einer neuen Verstandigung daruber gesucht, was die Gesellschaft von der Landwirtschaft erwartet, und welche Unterstutzung die Landwirtinnen und Landwirte im Gegenzug dafur erwarten durfen. Vor diesem Hintergrund entwickelt das vorliegende Open Access-Buch eine wissenschaftlich fundierte Kritik der Umweltauswirkungen der Landwirtschaft und der politischen Logik der Agrarpolitik. Es prasentiert ein neues Leitbild mit konkreten Indikatoren sowie alternative strategische Handlungsoptionen. Die umfassende Analyse wird zu einem Vorschlag fur eine neue Architektur der europaischen Agrarpolitik gebundelt, die eine breite Diskussion um einen Neuen Gesellschaftsvertrag fur die Landwirtschaft in Deutschland und Europa anstosen soll.",2019-01-01,,,Springer,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-58656-3,,,,,TRUE,3,,2019,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2980461242,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-58656-3,book,,,

https://openalex.org/W3086060460,A sampling-based approach to identifying optimal inspection and repair strategies for offshore jacket structures,,"Identifying optimal inspection and repair strategies for offshore jacket structures is a challenging task. We present an approach, which is based on recent developments in the field of risk-based operation and maintenance planning at the structural system level. The approach utilizes heuristics to define inspection and repair strategies at the system level and to reduce the search space of possible strategies. For each defined strategy, the expected service life cost of inspection, repair and failure is evaluated based on simulated inspection and repair histories. Subset simulation is applied to compute the conditional repair and failure probabilities required for this analysis. It also forms the basis for simulating inspection and repair histories. The strategy that minimizes the expected service life cost is the optimal one in the set of pre-selected strategies. The underlying condition and performance model accounts for the stochastic dependence among the deterioration states of the different structural elements and the structural redundancy. The approach is demonstrated in a case study considering a jacket-type frame. In this study, we essentially vary the inspection interval, the minimum number of inspected components and the target reliability, and identify the combination that minimizes the expected total service life cost.

In this period, operas, concerts, and spoken theater pieces, traditionally performed in the same venue, were increasingly regarded as separate genres, each related to a specific sonic reverberation time. As this chapter illustrates using acoustic data from major venues, this separation corresponded with ever-diverging concepts of acoustic design and the acoustic properties of new buildings. The shift occurred, first, because of the emergence of a bourgeois theater and music culture and, second, due to a fundamental epistemic shift in acoustic theory when sound reflection began to be thought of as a phenomenon related to energy, time, and building materials.

For both evaluation methods we include imperfect channel knowledge at the receiver and the effects of the ADC in a wideband multi-user uplink scenario. For the system we choose a configuration defined by 3GPP New Radio (5G). Our results show a performance gap between the two systems, which is comparable to other evaluations of this kind for systems like LTE (4G). In the low-to-medium SNR regime from −20 to 0 dB there is a constant difference of about 4 dB between the two evaluation methods.

In addition to the traditional ACM WiSec topics of physical, link, and network layer security, WiSec'16 has continued to solicit papers focusing on the security and privacy of mobile software platforms, usable security and privacy, biometrics, cryptography, and the increasingly diverse range of mobile or wireless applications such as Internet of Things, and Cyber-Physical Systems.

This year, WiSec received 71 complete paper submissions from around the world. Authors denoted 20 of these submissions as short papers, and no papers were reclassified during the reviewing process. There were many interesting and exciting papers. After a multiple round reviewing process, our program committee selected 13 full papers and 7 short papers for presentation and publication in the conference proceedings. These papers will be presented in a single track, along with a poster and demonstration session that will provide early results as well as mature and practical prototypes. New this year, we have made short public reviews for all accepted papers available on the conference website. Recognizing that no paper is perfect, we hope to provide the community with greater insight into the program committee's decision process.

In addition to the research papers presented at the conference, we have an exciting keynote to be delivered by Prof. Jean-Pierre Hubaux (The Ultimate Frontier for Privacy and Security: Medicine). Prof. Hubaux is one of the founders of WiSec.

https://openalex.org/W2806256511,Visual Representations in Science,,"Visual representations (photographs, diagrams, etc.) play crucial roles in scientific processes. They help, for example, to communicate research results and hypotheses to scientific peers as well as to the lay audience. In genuine research activities they are used as evidence or as surrogates for research objects which are otherwise cognitively inaccessible. Despite their important functional roles in scientific practices, philosophers of science have more or less neglected visual representations in their analyses of epistemic methods and tools of reasoning in science. This book is meant to fill this gap. It presents a detailed investigation into central conceptual issues and into the epistemology of visual representations in science.

It highlights the common ground between groups on the right-wing fringe of each country’s party system. To an extent the differences between the way right-wing groups developed in each of these countries is due to the different histories of the respective states. Recently however, they have moved closer to each other in the face of very similar problems. To a degree Switzerland is a special case because of its multilingual cantons and the early development of a pluralist civic culture that sustains an extraordinarily dynamic democratic constitutional state. This is particularly true given the autocratic relapses toward right-wing politics in neighboring German-speaking countries.",2018-04-26,Oxford Handbooks Online,,Oxford University Press,,https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190274559.013.23,,,,,FALSE,4,,2018,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2791126774,,https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190274559.013.23,book,,,

https://openalex.org/W2802352283,The Continuing Arms Race: Code-Reuse Attacks and Defenses,,"As human activities have moved to the digital domain, so have all the well-known malicious behaviors including fraud, theft, and other trickery. There is no silver bullet, and each security threat calls for a specific answer. One particular threat is that applications accept malformed inputs, and in many cases it is possible to craft inputs that let an intruder take full control over the target computer system.

The nature of systems programming languages lies at the heart of the problem. Rather than rewriting decades of well-tested functionality, this book examines ways to live with the (programming) sins of the past while shoring up security in the most efficient manner possible. We explore a range of different options, each making significant progress toward securing legacy programs from malicious inputs.

The solutions explored include enforcement-type defenses, which exclude certain program executions because they never arise during normal operation. Another strand explores the idea of presenting adversaries with a moving target that unpredictably changes its attack surface thanks to randomization. We also cover tandem execution ideas where the compromise of one executing clone causes it to diverge from another, thus revealing adversarial activities.",2018-03-01,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3129743,,,,,FALSE,2,,2018,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2802352283,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3129743,book,,,

Agent-based models have been applied to explain stylized facts of labor markets as well as for labor market policy evaluations. They also constitute a major part in agent-based macroeconomic models. Besides reviewing the various results achieved, we discuss modeling choices with respect to agents’ behavior and the structure of interaction. Our overall assessment is that agent-based labor market models have given us valuable insights into the functioning of labor markets and the consequences of labor market policies, and that they will increasingly become an essential tool of analysis, in particular when the construction of large macro-models is involved.

However, generically, smooth symbols on a manifold with boundary do not have this property, and several interesting applications require a corresponding more general calculus. We introduce here a new algebra of boundary value problems that contains Shapiro–Lopatinskij elliptic as well as global projection conditions; the latter ones are necessary, if an analogue of the Atiyah–Bott obstruction does not vanish. We show that every elliptic operator admits (up to a stabilisation) elliptic conditions of that kind. Corresponding boundary value problems are then Fredholm in adequate scales of spaces. Moreover, we construct parametrices in the calculus.",2018-01-01,Operator theory,https://openalex.org/V2764910388,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70114-1,,,,,FALSE,23,,2018,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W1977140875,,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-70114-1,book,,,
https://openalex.org/W2618902684,Economic Nonlinear Model Predictive Control,,"Model Predictive Control (MPC) can be dated back to the 1960s, and can now be regarded as a mature control method, which has had significant impact on industrial process control. It is applied in many control systems and has been extended to include non-linear dynamics and non-convex constraints. Of increasing importance in all such control systems in the economic benefits within the design of the system. Traditionally, the so-called control pyramid has been the main technique to do this, whereby economic targets are translated into setpoints and reference trajectories, which are in turn stabilized by control techniques such as MPC. At the same time, in process systems engineering and other fields of application, one aims at economic process operation and much attention has been given to this and the term Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) has been coined. Economic Nonlinear Model Predictive Control provides a concise overview of different approaches on the question of stability and optimality in different formulations of EMPC. It is the first monograph to cover approaches both with and without terminal constraints and end penalties, and turnpike/dissipativity-based settings as well as Lyapunov-based approaches. This monograph is an accessible tutorial on the state-of-the-art in model predictive control.

Wahrend nationalistische und populistische Stromungen das Projekt der europaischen Integration als Angriff auf das Prinzip der Volkssouveranitat verunglimpfen, verteidigen EU-Befurworter den Integrationsprozess als einen erfolgreichen Modus der gemeinschaftlichen Ausubung nationaler Souveranitat. Inwiefern ist der populistische Verweis auf Volkssouveranitat legitim? Und inwiefern gefahrden Populismus und Nationalismus durch eben diesen Topos die Demokratie in Europa?

https://openalex.org/W2797387136,Agronomic efficiency and heavy metal contamination of phosphorus (P) recycling products from old sewage sludge ash landfills,,"In einem modifizierten Neubauer-Gefasversuch mit Roggen wurde die agronomische Effizienz von Recyclingprodukten untersucht, die aus einer fur ca. 10 Jahre deponierten Klarschlammasche aus Monoverbrennung hergestellt wurden. Folgende Produkte wurden getestet: die deponierte Klarschlamm-Rohasche aus chemischer Fallung (SSA 1), ein Saureauszug ohne (SSA 2) und mit anschliesender Ca-P-Fallung (SSA 3), und ein Produkt, welches nach dem Saureaufschluss einer Kationenaustauschprozedur unterworfen wurde (SSA 4). Zum Vergleich wurde eine thermochemisch behandelte Klarschlammasche (SSA-TC) mit untersucht, die den gegenwartigen Stand der Technik reprasentiert. Als Referenz wurde ein kommer­zieller wasserloslicher P-Mineraldunger (Superphosphat, SSP) eingesetzt. Die NAC-Loslichkeit von SSA 2–4 wurde durch den Saureaufschluss auf ein Niveau von 87–92% des Gesamt-P angehoben, im Vergleich zu 36,5% in der Rohasche (SSA 1) und 63% in SSA-TC. SSA 4 war das einzige Testprodukt mit einer hohen Wasserloslichkeit (77% des Gesamt-P). Die auf den Trockenmasseertrag bezogene relative agronomische Effizienz (RAE-DMY) zeigte keine grosen Unterschiede zwischen den Varianten, bei der optimalen P-Stufe (20 mg) variierte sie zwischen 84% des DMY-SSP fur die Rohasche SSA 1 und 91% fur SSA 2. Die Kalkulation der RAE bezogen auf die P-Aufnahme (RAE-PU) zeigte eine deutlichere Variation: Bei der P-Stufe 20 rangierte die RAE-PU zwischen 53,5% fur SSA 1 und 99% fur SSA 4. Somit unterschied sich SSA 4, das einzige wasserlosliche Testprodukt, deutlich von den nicht wasserloslichen Varianten. Allerdings verzeichnete SSA 4 in der hochsten P-Stufe (40 mg) einen deutlichen Einbruch sowohl beim DMY als auch bei der P-Aufnahme. Dies war eine Folge von Na-Toxizitat, die durch die behandlungsbedingt stark erhohte Na-Konzentration dieses Testproduktes verursacht wurde.Mit der Saurebehandlung konnten die Schwermetallgehalte (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, Tl, Zn) der Rohasche signifikant reduziert werden, so dass die Grenzwerte der deutschen Dungemittelverordnung sicher eingehalten wurden. Die Urankonzentration war bereits im Ausgangs­material gering (2,9 mg/kg DM). Allerdings war auch die Ca-P-Fallung (SSA 3) nicht in der Lage, die hohen Fe- und Al-Konzentrationen des Ausgangsmaterials hinreichend zu reduzieren, um die (Re-)Formierung von unloslichen Fe/Al-Phosphaten wahrend des Experiments zu verhindern. Wahrend durch einen Austausch der Kationen Al und Fe gegen Na (SSA 4) die Pflanzenverfugbarkeit und -aufnahme von P erhoht wurden, verursachte diese Behandlung andere, mit den ebenfalls erhohten Na-Gehalten verbundene Schwierigkeiten.Das Experiment fuhrte zu der Schlussfolgerung, dass weitere Versuchsansatze erforderlich sind, um P in einer Form aus der Klarschlammasche zu gewinnen, welche zugleich pflanzenverfugbar ist und moglichst geringe wachstumsreduzierende Kontaminanten wie Natrium oder Schwermetalle enthalt, damit aschebasierte Recyclingdunger in Zukunft attraktiver werden.",2017-11-01,Journal für Kulturpflanzen,,,,https://doi.org/10.1399/jfk.2017.11.02,373,385,69,11,TRUE,0,,2017,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2797387136,,https://doi.org/10.1399/jfk.2017.11.02,book,,,
https://openalex.org/W2911840560,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Workshop on Multimedia-based Educational and Knowledge Technologies for Personalized and Social Online Training,,"It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 1st International Workshop on Multimedia-based Educational and Knowledge Technologies for Personalized and Social Online Training -- MultiEdTech 2017. Educational and Knowledge Technologies (EdTech), especially in connection to multimedia content and the vision of mobile and personalized learning, is a hot topic in both academia and the business start-ups ecosystem. The driver and enabler of this is on the one side the development and widespread availability of multimedia materials and MOOCs, which represent multimedia content produced specifically for supporting e-learning; and, on the other side, the ever increasing availability of all sorts on information on the Internet and in social media channels (e. g., lectures, research papers, user-generated videos, news items), which, despite not directly targeting e-learning, can prove to be valuable complements to the more targeted learning materials. Although the availability of such content is not a problem these days, finding the right content and associating different relevant pieces of multimedia so as to enable a comprehensive learning experience on a chosen subject is by no means a trivial task.

The MultiEdTech 2017 workshop provides a forum for presenting research in areas related to multimedia-based educational and knowledge technologies and particularly on the use of multimedia search and retrieval, analysis and understanding, browsing, summarization, recommendation, and visualization technologies on multimedia content available in specialized learning platforms, the Web, mobile devices and/or social networks for supporting personalized and adaptive e-learning and training.

The workshop will be kicked off with an exciting keynote talk: 
Dr. Pablo Cesar from CWI, Amsterdam on Sensing Engagement: Helping Performers to Evaluate their Impact. Dr. Cesar leads the Interactive and Distributed Systems group at CWI, which focuses on facilitating and improving the way people access media and communicate with others and with the environment. The keynote will overview on gathering data and understanding the experience of people attending cultural events, public lectures, and courses by using wearable sensor technology. Through practical case studies in different areas of the creative industries and education, it will showcase results and discuss about failures.

https://openalex.org/W2796099086,Environments of Intelligence: From natural information to artificial interaction,,"What is the role of the environment, and of the information it provides, in cognition? More specifically, may there be a role for certain artefacts to play in this context? These are questions that motivate 4E theories of cognition (as being embodied, embedded, extended, enactive). In his take on that family of views, Hajo Greif first defends and refines a concept of information as primarily natural, environmentally embedded in character, which had been eclipsed by information-processing views of cognition. He continues with an inquiry into the cognitive bearing of some artefacts that are sometimes referred to as 'intelligent environments'. Without necessarily having much to do with Artificial Intelligence, such artefacts may ultimately modify our informational environments.
With respect to human cognition, the most notable effect of digital computers is not that they might be able, or become able, to think but that they alter the way we perceive, think and act.

Based on an analysis of uncertainty in the combined innovation and acquisition process we formulate hypotheses on how this categorization relates to various dimensions of target maturity. Using a unique dataset of 215 acquisitions in the field of artificial intelligence, we find clear evidence that targets in performance-focused acquisitions are younger, smaller, and less likely to have a marketable product than those in functionality-focused acquisitions.

It is argued that this is attributed to the presence of a defective v (or Voice) in their syntactic representation. The main concern of the chapter is to address the question what it is about nounness that obligatorily triggers the presence of an ergative case pattern. It is argued that this follows from the requirement that nominalizers embed structures that do not project external arguments. Specifically, the presence of a nominalizer head in a syntactic structure creates an environment in which only one argument can receive structural Case. As a result, an ergative case pattern emerges.",2017-06-15,Oxford Handbooks Online,,,,https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198739371.013.15,,,,,FALSE,0,,2017,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2966325140,,https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198739371.013.15,book,,,

https://openalex.org/W2907477820,Higher Education and the Student: From welfare state to neoliberalism,,"As one of the pioneers and leading advocates of neoliberalism, Britain, and in particular England, has radically transformed its higher education system over the last decades. Universities have increasingly been required to act like businesses, and students are frequently referred to as customers nowadays. Higher Education and the Student investigates precisely this relation between the changing function of higher education and what we consider the term ‘student’ to stand for.
Based on a detailed analysis of government papers, reports, and speeches as well as publications by academics and students, the book explores how the student has been conceptualised within the debate on higher education from the birth of the British welfare state in the 1940s until today. It thus offers a novel assessment of the history of higher education and shows how closely the concept of the student and the way we comprehend higher education are intertwined. Higher Education and the Student opens up a new perspective that can critically inform public debate and future policy – in Britain and beyond.

https://openalex.org/W3022373757,Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Workshop on Interacting with Smart Objects,,"These are the proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Interacting with Smart Objects (SmartObjects '17) in conjunction with IUI'17.

Objects that we use in our everyday life are ever-expanding their interaction capabilities and provide functionalities that go far beyond their original functionality. They feature computing capabilities and are, thus, able to capture, process and store information and interact with their environments, turning them into smart objects. Their wide range was covered by the submissions to this workshop.

Smart objects know something about their users and, thus, allow for natural interaction. Natural interaction, in contrast, does not imply smartness. Smartness requires interaction with users and provides help. There are already commercialized products available that expose their properties and interaction capabilities. To enrich their potential and to lower affordances, they need to talk to each other. Making sense out of the available data in this field is still an open research question. The overall goal should be to build an interactive ecosystem that (i) seamlessly discovers, connects and talks to its environment, (ii) is ubiquitous and (iii) allows the user to be in control.

The workshop examined these issues with regards to the following aspects: 
Smart Cars
Smart Surfaces
Smart Homes and IoT



We are excited to welcome Dr. Stefan Radomski as our keynote speaker for his talk From IoT to WoT: Can we reproduce the success of HTML in Smart Environments: Today, interaction within smart device landscapes is still, predominantly, characterized by isolated applications constrained to the ecosystem of a consortium or only a single vendor. When we regard the success of HTML to transform the Internet onto the Web, the question arises whether we can duplicate a similar transformation for the interaction with smart objects. In his talk, Stefan Radomski will give an overview of the current ambitions to standardize interfaces and interactions for smart environments.",2017-03-13,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3038450,,,,,FALSE,0,,2017,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3022373757,,https://doi.org/10.1145/3038450,proceedings,,,
https://openalex.org/W826472649,Increasing Motorcycle Conspicuity : Design and Assessment of Interventions to Enhance Rider Safety,,"The use of Powered Two Wheelers (PTW; motorcycles, scooters, mopeds) continues to steadily increase in both developing and developed countries. Increasing the visibility of PTWs to other road users will become a progressively important avenue for improving rider safety. The package of research presented in this paper was part of the European Commissionrs 2-be-Safe project, involving 27 research organisations across Europe and Australia, a world first human factors approach to better understanding and improving PTW safety. A package of this research, involving 8 research groups across Europe and Australia, this paper presents the first collection of research that examines the influence of a wide range of factors on PTW rider detection by car drivers. The experimental studies presented here used driving simulation and still images to assess the efficacy of various treatments (clothing colour, lighting configuration, etc) on driversr interactions with PTWs. This paper focuses on the outcomes from the Australian research. This research provides detailed theoretical and practical guidance on the development and evaluation of measures designed to increase PTW visibility in traffic.",2017-03-02,"Australasian Road Safety Research Policing Education Conference, 2013, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",,CRC Press,,https://doi.org/10.1201/9781315588254,,,,,FALSE,3,,2017,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W826472649,,https://doi.org/10.1201/9781315588254,monograph,,,
https://openalex.org/W3105684730,Experimental validation of a Monte-Carlo-based inversion scheme for 3D quantitative photoacoustic tomography,,"Quantitative photoacoustic tomography (qPAT) aims to extract physiological parameters, such as blood oxygen saturation (sO2), from measured multi-wavelength image data sets. The challenge of this approach lies in the inherently nonlinear fluence distribution in the tissue, which has to be accounted for by using an appropriate model, and the large scale of the inverse problem. In addition, the accuracy of experimental and scanner-specific parameters, such as the wavelength dependence of the incident fluence, the acoustic detector response, the beam profile and divergence, needs to be considered. This study aims at quantitative imaging of blood sO2, as it has been shown to be a more robust parameter compared to absolute concentrations. We propose a Monte-Carlo–based inversion scheme in conjunction with a reduction in the number of variables achieved using image segmentation. The inversion scheme is experimentally validated in tissue-mimicking phantoms consisting of polymer tubes suspended in a scattering liquid. The tubes were filled with chromophore solutions at different concentration ratios. 3-D multi-spectral image data sets were acquired using a Fabry-Perot based PA scanner. A quantitative comparison of the measured data with the output of the forward model is presented. Parameter estimates of chromophore concentration ratios were found to be within 5 % of the true values.",2017-03-01,Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) Conference Series,,,,https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/bitstream/11303/11640/4/buchmann_jens.pdf,1006416,,10064,,FALSE,1,,2017,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W3105684730,,https://doi.org/10.14279/depositonce-10528,dissertation,,,

This groundbreaking book approaches descriptive complexity from the angle of modern structural graph theory, specifically graph minor theory. It develops a 'definable structure theory' concerned with the logical definability of graph theoretic concepts such as tree decompositions and embeddings. The first part starts with an introduction to the background, from logic, complexity, and graph theory, and develops the theory up to first applications in descriptive complexity theory and graph isomorphism testing. It may serve as the basis for a graduate-level course. The second part is more advanced and mainly devoted to the proof of a single, previously unpublished theorem: properties of graphs with excluded minors are decidable in polynomial time if, and only if, they are definable in fixed-point logic with counting.",2017-01-01,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1017/9781139028868,,,,,FALSE,30,,2017,https://api.openalex.org/works?filter=cites:W2743930031,,https://doi.org/10.1017/9781139028868,monograph,,,
